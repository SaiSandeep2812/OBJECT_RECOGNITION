Developed a multiple object recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect and classify objects in images. Preprocessed image data by resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance. Designed and trained a CNN model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to extract features and perform object classification. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand class distributions and evaluate dataset quality. Optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning and evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
